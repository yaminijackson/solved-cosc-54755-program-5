Write the following program. How you design the user interface is up to you, using everything that has been taught in class, but you must use the drawing methods, as explained in the drawing lectures. You can’t use widgets for the tic-tac-toe board. Code will be graded on correctness, comments, and coding style.

<strong>Tic-tac-toe program:</strong>

Write a Tic-tac-toe game. You will need to leave you code “flexible”, because we use this code next semester where you will add the network/Bluetooth/sms code to this program. Player X also goes first.

For 4730 students: Your program will be a two player game, alternating between each player, assuming they “pass” the phone back and forth. Your code will need to determine winner, loser, tie. You will also be able to play again (play another game) without having to restart the program.

For 5730 students: Complete the requirements for 4730 program and your program will have an option for the other player to be an AI player. The user will determine if they want to be X or O. The AI doesn’t need to be very smart, but it must be “smarter” then just picking a random location and it should play to win.
